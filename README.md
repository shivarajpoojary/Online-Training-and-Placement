# Online-Training-and-Placement

This system contains information about all the students. The system checks for
eligibility criteria and sends mail to all the students who are eligible for training and
placement. Here, the system has two phases, the first one is admin and the second one is
students. Admin is having the rights to add the company details, test details, and sending
emails to those who selected. Another side, that is student, they can register to take
participation in the placement program by providing their information, taking an online test
and seeing the results, etc.

An online system for training and placement can be used as an application for the
Training and placement officers of the college to manage the student information about
placements and training. Students logging in should be able to fill the registration form. The
key feature of this project is that it is a one-time registration. The application provides the
facility for maintaining the details of the students. It also provides a requested list of
candidates to recruit the students based on a given query. Administrator logging in may also
search any information put up by the students. This project will aid colleges to practice full
IT deployment. This will also help in fast access procedures in placement related activities.
With that admin can post practice tests to the students
